# FPS-Parkour-Controller-Unity
It's a physics-based character controller I built a while ago. Instead of using state machine as I do in my current projects, I wrote it as hard-coded. It has wall running and wall jumping features. 

Since it is self-contained, you can take the prefab and the controller script, and use it directly in your own project.
